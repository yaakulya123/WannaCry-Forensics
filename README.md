## About WannaCry

WannaCry (also known as WannaCrypt, WannaCry0r, or WCry) was a devastating ransomware attack that spread globally in May 2017. It was one of history's largest and most damaging cyberattacks.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Exploitation Method**: Leveraged the EternalBlue exploit targeting SMBv1 vulnerability (MS17-010)
- **Origin**: EternalBlue was allegedly developed by the NSA and leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group
- **Encryption**: Used RSA-2048 and AES-128 encryption to lock files with .WNCRY extension
- **Distribution**: Self-propagating worm capability that spread across networks
- **Impact**: Affected over 200,000 computers across 150+ countries with damages estimated at billions of USD
- **Notable Targets**: National Health Service (UK), Telef√≥nica (Spain), FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, and many others
- **Kill Switch**: Contained a domain check that, when registered, stopped the malware's spread

### üìä Timeline of the Attack

| Date (2017) | Event |
|-------------|-------|
| March 14 | Microsoft releases patch for MS17-010 vulnerability |
| April 14 | EternalBlue exploit released by Shadow Brokers |
| May 12 | WannaCry ransomware attack begins |
| May 12 | Security researcher registers kill switch domain, slowing the spread |
| May 14 | "WannaDecrypt0r 2.0" variant without kill switch appears |
| May 15 | Marcus Hutchins (MalwareTech) recognized for discovering kill switch |

## Extreme Safety Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**The WannaCry.exe sample included in this repository is ACTUAL MALWARE and should be treated with extreme caution:**

- **NEVER** execute this file on any production system or personal computer
- **ALWAYS** use in isolated, air-gapped virtual environments specifically configured for malware analysis
- **ENSURE** all network connectivity is disabled before analysis
- **CREATE** snapshots of your analysis environment before beginning work
- **UNDERSTAND** that running this file outside a controlled environment may result in:
  - Permanent encryption of files
  - Lateral movement to other network-connected systems
  - Data loss
  - Privacy breaches
  - Legal liability

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNING**: The actual WannaCry ransomware encrypts files and demands payment in Bitcoin. Recovery without the decryption key is extremely difficult or impossible.
